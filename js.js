//* Problem 1: Student Result System
// You're building a system for a school to manage student results.

let student = {
  name: "Sakib Khan",
  age: 17,
  class: 10,
  marks: {
    math: 88,
    english: 76,
    science: 92
  }
};

//? Tasks:
// Check if the student has passed all subjects (passing mark is 40).
// Calculate and print the average marks.
// If average > 85, print "Grade: A", else if > 70 "Grade: B", else "Grade: C".
